"""The money in the documents, against the money in the files.

`domain-knowledge.md` opens by saying every figure in it is measured, and that
**a lesson without a number is an opinion**. The numbers are therefore the whole
argument, and they are typed by hand into three documents from files sitting in
`output/`.

A figure that drifts is worse than one that was never given. It reads as
evidence, it is quoted onward, and the file it came from still says something
else.

**A**, not T: it reads text and compares it against JSON. It cannot check a
figure no file carries — the $0.07–$0.13 of an outline audit, or a duration — and
those are left alone rather than approximated.
